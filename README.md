# Kevin Vo's portfolio
This is a collection of notebooks that I created for data analysis. All of the project titles are links to the notebooks on GitHub unless otherwise stated. 

## Guided Projects
These are guided projects that I have completed from Dataquest.io to learn the fundamental workflow of data analysis.
### [Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_15%20Winning%20Jeopardy.ipynb)
### [Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_14%20Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In.ipynb)
### [Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_13%20Investigating%20Fandango%20Movie%20Ratings.ipynb)
### [Designing and Creating a Database](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_12%20Designing%20and%20Creating%20a%20Database.ipynb)
### [Answering Business Questions Using SQL](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_11%20Answering%20Business%20Questions%20using%20SQL.ipynb)
### [Analyzing CIA Factbooks Data Using SQLite and Python](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_10%20Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20SQLite%20and%20Python.ipynb)
### [Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_7%20Star%20Wars%20Survey.ipynb)
In this guided project, I analyze survey data about Star Wars that FiveThirtyEight conducted. This project focused on cleaning data and having it manner more suitable for analysis and presentation. 
### [Analyzing NYC High School Data](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_6%20Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data.ipynb)
Real world data is never clean, so it important to understand the fundamentals of cleaning and combining data. This project was an exercise on how to combined different dataset and clean the data (converting columns to the correct datatype, handling invalid data, etc.).
### [Visualizing The Gender Gap in College Degrees](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_5%20Visualizing%20The%20Gender%20Gap%20In%20College%20Degrees.ipynb)
This project builds upon the previous, focusing on making visualizations clearer by following guidelines put forth by Edward Tufte, a pioneer in the field of data visualization.
### [Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_4%20Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors.ipynb)
I utilize the basics of Matplotlib to visualize data about earnings based on college majors and get a quick idea of the data I am looking at.
### [Analyzing Thanksgiving Dinners](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_3%20Analyzing%20Thanksgiving%20Dinner.ipynb)
In this project, I analyzed survey data about Thanksgiving dinners (how far the respondent traveled, what they ate, etc.) using NumPy and pandas.
### [Exploring Gun Deaths in the US](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_2%20Exploring%20Gun%20Deaths%20in%20the%20US.ipynb)
This guided project apply more intermediate elements of Python such as classes, regular expressions, datetime, etc.  
### [Explore US Births](https://github.com/kevin-kvo/portfolio/blob/master/Dataquest_guided_projects/Guided%20Project_1%20Explore%20U.S.%20Births.ipynb)
This is the first guided project on Dataquest, intended to utilize the basics of Python (for loops, if statements, functions, etc.).
