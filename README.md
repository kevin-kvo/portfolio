# Kevin Vo's portfolio
This is a collection of notebooks that I created for data analysis. All of the project titles are links to the notebooks viewed through nbviewer in order to render the outputs. 

## Guided Projects
These are guided projects that I have completed from Dataquest.io to learn the fundamental workflow of data analysis.
### [ExploreUSBirths](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kevin-kvo/ExploreUSBirths/blob/master/Basics.ipynb)
This is the first guided project on Dataquest, intended to teach the basics of Python (for loops, functions, etc.).
